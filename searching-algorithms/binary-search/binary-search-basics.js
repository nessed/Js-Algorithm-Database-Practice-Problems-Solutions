// Binary search pseudocode

// If the array is empty, return -1 as the element cannot be found.
// If the array has elements, find the middle element in the array. If the target is equal to the middle element, return the middle element index.
// If the target is less than the middle element, binary search the left half of the array.
// If the target is greater than the middle element, binary search the right half of the array.
