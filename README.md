# JS and CS Fundamentals Repository

## Welcome to my repository! Here, I've compiled a series of exercises and solutions focusing on JavaScript and Computer Science fundamentals. This repository showcases my journey of learning and improving my skills over time. You'll find a range of topics covered, from data structures and algorithms to problem-solving patterns and more.

### Feel free to clone this repository for easy access to structured notes and exercises covering basic Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). I've organized everything in a way that's easy to navigate, making it convenient for both learning and revision purposes! Additionally, I plan to upload PDF-based learning notes for DSA as soon I find an easy way to push them onto GitHub from evernote.

### What You'll Find
Let me walk you through the contents of this repository:

#### 1. Data Structures
Explore various JavaScript implementations of fundamental data structures such as hash tables, linked lists, classes etc.

#### 2. Internship Data Structure and Algorithms Problems
This section houses a collection of problems i was assigned to perform in a learning internship that i started in May 2024. I was assigned problems related to array manipulation, algorithm usage, data structure usage (with run time and auxilary space constraints)
The folder containts level 1 (easier) and level 2 (more difficult) problems with each sub problem saved in its own folder. Some problems have multiple solved solutions as some solutions were refactored for better readability or performance after writing the intiial solution (or the dumb/bad solution as they are referred to in this folder)

#### 3. LeetCode Solutions
Find solutions to problems that i solved sourced from LeetCode, neatly organized for easy reference.

#### 4. Problem-Solving Patterns
Discover different problem-solving patterns and techniques, such as frequency checkers and sliding windows and their applications.

#### 5. Random Learning with JavaScript
Miscellaneous learning and experimentation with JavaScript with random things such as jest testing.

#### 6. Searching Algorithms
Explore implementations of various searching algorithms such as binary or linear searching and their applications.

#### 7. Sorting Algorithms
Check out implementations of various sorting algorithms such as selection sort, insertion sort, bubble sort etc.
